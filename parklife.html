							<h1 class="section-title">Installation</h1>
							<p>Installation requirements:<br/>
								<ul>
									<li>A copy of the source code, fetched either via git or some other mean</li>
									<li>An account in Google App Engine, please apply via <a href="http://www.appspot.com">http://www.appspot.com</a></li>
									<li>The Google App Engine SDK installed in your workstation, you can obtain
										it from <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">here</a>
										(any of the operating systems supported by GAE will do)
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								Import the Parklife code into the GAE SDK, via option "Add Existing application..."
								in the "File" menu in the Google App Engine launcher. You can set the 
								application ID to anything you like, as long as it's unique within the Google
								App Engine platform (the App Engine launcher will warn you during the deployment
								if the application ID is not unique)
							</p>
							<p>
								Once the application has been imported, and before deployment, you must customize
								file <b>defaults.py</b> file, as it contains important configuration parameters:
								<ul>
									<li>YOUTUBE_API_KEY: A YouTube API key is necessary in order to be able
										to pull data from YouTube feeds. If you don't have one, you must
										apply for one</li>
									<li>GOOGLE_API_KEY: The search capabilities in Parklife are implemented via
										a Google custom search engine. Therefore, you must also apply for a 
										Google API key</li>
									<li>GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: The geolocation features in Parklife are built upon
										Google Maps, for which you will also need a valid API key</li>
									<li>GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_KEY: This is the key identifying your custom
										search engine, and it can be obtained from your custom search engine's
										control panel</li>
									<li>DISQUS_USER: Comments in Parklife are handled by Disqus.com. If you plan
										to turn commenting on in your stream, you must register first with Disqus and
										then provide your username here</li>
								</ul>
								<br/>
								Additionally, the <b>site</b> variable contains some site-wide parameters such as:
								<ul>
									<li>base_url: Base location where the lifestream is located</li>
									<li>author: Name of the owner of the stream</li>
									<li>email: Email address of the owner of the stream. Optional, only used in Atom feeds.</li>
									<li>title: Name of the stream/blog</li>
									<li>subtitle: Subtitle/taglife of the stream/blog</li>		
								</ul><br/>
								The values of these parameters are used in several places throughout the pages.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once the default settings have been configured, the application is ready to be 
								deployed to the Google App Engine via the App Engine launcher application. You must at
								least set one administrator user in the Google App Engine dashboard, as this is the user
								that will have access to configure the settings and manage entries.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now that the application has been deployed, please proceed to <b>http://your-app-id.appspot.com/admin/settings</b>. If
								you had not logged in yet, Google will ask you to authenticate. Upon authentication, you will be greeted by
								a basic screen where you will introduce the some basic parameters required for each one of the sources.
							</p>
							<p>
								When these settings have been configured, we can run of the scheduled jobs manually to give the stream
								some initial content, please proceed to the following URLs:
								<ul>
									<li>http://your-app-id.appspot.com/tasks/update/twitter</li>
									<li>http://your-app-id.appspot.com/tasks/update/youtube</li>
									<li>http://your-app-id.appspot.com/tasks/update/delicious</li>
									<li>http://your-app-id.appspot.com/tasks/update/googlereader</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								In order to pot new blog entries, the URL is http://your-app-id.appspot.com/admin/blog.
							</p>
							<h1 class="section-title">Customizing Parklife</h1>
							<p>
								The look of parklife is mainly customizable via CSS. Please dive into file public/css/styles.css and feel free
								to play around with the styles.
							</p>
							<p>
								Additionally, it is possible to customize Parklife's template if you're familiar with
								Python and the Django template system. Parklife templates are located in
								app/templates/
